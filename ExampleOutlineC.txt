Instead of class, want fileNames.
Will need to create method stubs at the top of the file
Structs?
Getters, Setters, toString won't be a thing
Should a header file be created automatically? I'd say yes
#define, #include, typedef, struct, method stubs all go in header files (with an ifdef, define)
The methods with empty bodies and a #include cfile.h will be the only things that go in the .c file
